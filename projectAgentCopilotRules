# Project Agent Copilot Rules

- Keep code in one file, under 400 lines total.
- do not over fit for specific task.
- No sandboxing, validation, token management, encryption, or databases.
- Use rich manifest and function definitions to handle parsing/summarization issues.
- State management via simple in-memory or basic file tracking, no complex persistence.
- Logs output to terminal and a single txt file only.
- No human-in-the-loop or approval UI; user kills process with Ctrl+C if needed.
- No error handling/recovery; assume clean runs.
- No dependency checks or environment assumptions beyond basics.
- Function calls can batch multiple, but LLM waits for all to finish before output.
- Focus on LLM agent loop with functions; avoid adding extra components.
- Never lie to the user; be precise and honest about capabilities and results.
