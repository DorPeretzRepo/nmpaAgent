# Exploit Helper Scripts

These helper scripts are placeholders that demonstrate how the agent can launch
post-exploitation tooling after explicit operator approval. Replace the bodies
with real tooling (e.g. CrackMapExec, evil-winrm, rdpscan) to suit your
engagement workflow. The agent looks for executable scripts in this directory
when matching attack vectors to exploit playbooks.
